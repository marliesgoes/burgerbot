def get_camera_image():
    """
    Captures an image using the system's camera and returns it.

    This function is assumed to interface with a camera device, capture a still image,
    and return it in a format that is compatible with further image processing functions.

    Returns:
        image: An image object that can be processed by other functions. The exact format
               of this object will depend on the implementation details and the image
               processing library being used.

def find_center_of(ingredient, image):
    """
    Locates the center of a specified ingredient in the given image.

    This function is designed to perform image segmentation and object recognition
    within the provided image to find the specified ingredient. It then calculates
    and returns the coordinates of the center of that ingredient.

    Parameters:
        ingredient (str): The name of the ingredient to locate in the image.
        image: The image object captured from the camera in which to find the ingredient.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple of (x, y) coordinates representing the central point of the ingredient
               in the image space.

def camera_to_robot_coords(camera_coords):
    """
    Converts camera image space coordinates to robot arm's coordinate system.

    Given a point in the image captured by the camera, this function converts that point
    to a coordinate system that can be understood by the robot arm, allowing for accurate
    positioning and movement.

    Parameters:
        camera_coords (tuple): A tuple of (x, y) coordinates in the camera's image space.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple of (x, y, z) coordinates in the robot's coordinate system.

def move_item(pickup_coords, dropoff_coords):
    """
    Commands the robot to move an item from pickup coordinates to dropoff coordinates.

    This function directs the robot arm to move to the pickup coordinates, secure the item,
    and then move it to the specified dropoff coordinates. This may involve complex path
    planning and collision avoidance depending on the implementation.

    Parameters:
        pickup_coords (tuple): The (x, y, z) coordinates where the robot will pick up the item.
        dropoff_coords (tuple): The (x, y, z) coordinates where the robot will place the item.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the item was successfully moved, False otherwise.
